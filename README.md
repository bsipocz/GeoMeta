# GeoMeta
Making locations citable.

## Project overview

Building tools to allow the sharing of geospatial metadata and the automatic reconstruction of datasets from raw data and metadata.

## The problem

In geoscience research, spatial data stored as two dimensional arrays, known as digital elevation models (DEMs). Researchers work on spatial subsets of this data, but only cite the original full dataset. This makes it challenging to reproduce geospatial research and results in a lack of transparency in research.

## Future steps

The next step for this project is to build out the code and tests to handle more edge cases, where bad data is provided, to attempt to steer the user to correct their data.

The eventual goal for the project is to host the tool online as a service, where researchers can create GeoMeta files without needing to install anything locally on their machines.
